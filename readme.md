## Digital control of analog signals

This project aims to develop a digitally controlled routing matrix between 8 preamps and 4 analogue inserts in a single containet case.

The system uses an Arduino Nano to control ~90 relays and display status as a grafical interface on a small screen using SPI.

**Features**
* Arduino Nano
* ST7735 TFT Display
* Rotary encoder
* 74595 shift registers
